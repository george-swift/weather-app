## Live Link
Visit the [Weather App](https://george-swift.github.io/weather-app/) to get started

### Objectives:
- Working with APIs
- Using ES7 Async functions and Promises
- Functional programming
- Principles of Object-oriented design
- Code organization with ES6 modules in Javascript
- Using Webpack for compiling Javascript modules
- DOM manipulation

## Features
The weather app renders a detailed meteorological report of the weather in a user's city or desired location. The application uses
the Open Weather API to provide requested data. To get a weather report, simply fill in the search field in the navbar with a city
name. By design, the temperature units default to Celsius. However, users can toggle the temperature unit to Fahrenheit from the 
`Unit` button, top-right in the navbar. To view other weather data, slide right on the widgets section. If weather information is 
unavailable for a given city, a modal will appear with respective information.
